## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
A login page is a fundamental component of many web applications that require user authentication. Developing a login page as part of a full-stack project involves implementing both frontend and backend functionalities. Here's an overview of the steps involved in creating a login page using a full-stack project:

Frontend Development:

Design the UI: Create a visually appealing and user-friendly login page using HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.
Form Validation: Implement client-side form validation to ensure that the user provides valid input, such as a valid email address and a strong password.
Send Data to Backend: When the user submits the login form, send the form data (e.g., username and password) to the backend for further processing.
Backend Development:

Handle HTTP Requests: Set up a backend server using a server-side language or framework such as Node.js with Express, Ruby on Rails, Django, or Flask.
Create User Database: Set up a database to store user information, including usernames and hashed passwords. Popular choices for database include MySQL
